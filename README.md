This app will be used to track the heart rate of participants in a psychology research study conducted by Professor Ken Abrams and his students at Carleton College.
Six participants will be wearing Polar H7 heart rate monitors, and the app (placed on six different iPads) will: 

a) Track the number of heartbeats that participants experience across fixed time periods.

b) Export the resulting data in the form of a .csv spreadsheet to Dropbox. The heart rate monitors send data via Bluetooth. Importantly, the app will be able to "lock in" to a particular heart rate monitor rather than grab data from the strongest signal it detects.
