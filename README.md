The results of the study that collected data using BeatBeacon are discussed on[ScienceTrends.com.](http://www.sciencetrends.com/might-accurate-heartbeat-perception-increase-the-risk-for-alcoholism/)

This app was used to track the heart rate of participants in a psychology research study conducted by Professor Ken Abrams and his students at Carleton College.

Goals while developing: 
Six participants will be wearing Polar H7 heart rate monitors, and the app (placed on six different iPads) will: 

a) Track the number of heartbeats that participants experience across fixed time periods.

b) Export the resulting data in the form of a .csv spreadsheet to Dropbox. The heart rate monitors send data via Bluetooth. Importantly, the app will be able to "lock in" to a particular heart rate monitor rather than grab data from the strongest signal it detects.
